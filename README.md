- run 'npm start'

# Description
Worked independently to create a basic full-stack nutrition tracking application. Had to self-teach and work with SQL, ReactJS, REST API, along with JavaScript itself, and make it work with Python on the server side. The app allows the user 
to set a calorie goal and browse a collection of foods, adding them to your collection. It also shows the nutrition information of each item as you select it and the total nutrition of all items that were added
to the user's collection. Accomplishes this using various React components and POST/PUSH/GET/DELETE requests. 

This project helped me improve my ability to teach myself new things effectively while working under new deadlines week to week. Almost everything I worked with in this class was brand new to me. I have previously used Python,
but other than that it was my first time working with the rest of these languages and frameworks. I gained a lot from this project, and although it is not perfect, it meets all the requirements that were given to me with little to no
bugs. The project as a whole really allowed me to show how self-sufficient I can be, and how even when I am working with things unfamiliar to me, my problem-solving skills outweigh that lack of experience in a given language or field.
